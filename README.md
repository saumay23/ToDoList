This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is a simple Todo List application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Jotai. It allows users to create, toggle the completion status of, and delete todo items. The application uses cookies to store the todo items, so the data will persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

Toggle the completion status of todo items
Delete todo items
Data persistence using cookies

## Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
Jotai: A state management library for React, providing atomic and synchronous updates.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
